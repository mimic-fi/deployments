## New deployments

To create a new deployment task simply create a new script as follows:
 
```
touch ./tasks/$TASK_ID/index.ts
```

To deploy any of the following tasks simply run:

```
yarn hardhat deploy --id $TASK_ID --network $NETWORK
```

Currently the available networks are: `goerli`, `kovan`, `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, `ropsten`, `polygon`, and `localhost`.

Tasks are not re-deployed unless you explicitly ask for it, to do so run the command with the `--force` flag.
